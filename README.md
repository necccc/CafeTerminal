# Cafe Terminal

Welcome to our impromptu coffeeshop where you can be the connected smart barista! Create the coffee that blends with technology, hack & tamper with hardware, and brew an espresso from the command line - or from the browser!

## Ingredients

- Any old school espresso machine, that can be controlled with relays. One relay for turning the power on, the other is to activate the pump. I have an old Saeco Gran Crema
- Microcontroller with wifi, I'm using a Tessel 2
- Sensor to check on the thermostat status led, using Tessel Ambient sensor
- Relays to power on things, using a 4-channel SainSmart relay, 230V/10A
- cables
- coffee
- water
